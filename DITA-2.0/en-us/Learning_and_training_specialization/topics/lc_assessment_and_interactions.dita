            <p>A &lt;learningAssessment> topic consists of assessment questions for students to
                answer. An assessment can be one question or a series of questions and can be placed
                before or after other learning content in a map. Assessments can act as pre-tests to
                place students or post-tests to verify students' retention of material. </p>
            <p>This topic type is particularly helpful since it allows you to create content for student versions and answer keys simultaneously.</p>
            <p>The main section of the topic goes within the &lt;learningAssessmentbody> element.
                Within that, questions are contained in the &lt;lcInteraction> element, but the body
                can also include other optional elements: <ul>
                    <li>&lt;lcIntro></li>
                    <li>&lt;lcObjectives></li>
                    <li>&lt;lcSummary></li>
                </ul></p>
            <p>The L&amp;T provides a variety of of assessment questions, including mulitple choice, true/false, matching, and more. These
                interactions are defined in the learningDomain2, which is explained in detail in the
                next topic.</p>
