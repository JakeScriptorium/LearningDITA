        <lcInstruction><p>A conref has two parts: </p><ul id="ul_ndg_4q3_mw">
                <li>The <b><i>referenced element</i></b>, which contains the content you want to
                    reuse. This element must have an ID attribute.</li>
                <li>The <b><i>referencing element</i></b>, which marks where the reused content
                    should be inserted.</li>
            </ul><note type="note">If the element you want to reuse does not
                have an ID, your DITA editor or content management system might prompt you to create
                an ID for the reused element as one of the steps in creating the conref. An ID must
                start with a letter, number, or underscore. </note><image

                id="image_tb2_1py_dw" base="2016/07"/><note type="tip">In writing about
                content references, the word conref is often used as a verb to mean “reuse an
                element by using the conref attribute.”</note><p>Conrefs are resolved at publishing
                time by an output generator. Many DITA editors can also resolve conrefs while you
                are editing a topic, which helps you see what the resolution of the conref will look
                like.</p><p>To resolve a conref, the output generator replaces the referencing
                element with the referenced element and all of its content. This includes any
                elements contained within the referenced element. For example, if a referenced
                &lt;p> element contains a &lt;uicontrol> element, the referencing &lt;p> element is
                replaced by the referenced &lt;p> element, including the &lt;uicontrol> element
                contained within it. Similarly, a conref to an &lt;ol> element includes all the
                &lt;li> elements that are contained by the referenced &lt;ol> element. </p><p>When
                the original content changes, those changes appear everywhere that content is
                referenced the next time it is published. </p></lcInstruction>
