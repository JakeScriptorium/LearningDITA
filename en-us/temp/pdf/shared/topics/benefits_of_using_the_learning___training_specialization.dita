                to output to many different formats. You could output to PDF for a printed textbook,
                or you could output to HTML for eLearning (with the help of a plugin). There is the
                option to use the same map for each, or even to create a seperate map that excludes
                specific learning topics. You might choose to exclude certain types of assessments
                from a print learning</p>

                meaning that the names of the elements give insight to how they are used. The
                element table indicates that what follows it are the contents of a table. In the
                Learning and training, the semantic elements are specific to the specialization: the
                learningOverviewbody element contains the body of a learningOverview topic</p>

                together into one learning object. Learning plans, overviews, contents, assessments,
                and summaries for one lesson can be grouped together into one learning object.</p>
